        "Este trabalho, realizado no âmbito da Unidade Curricular de Corpora nas Humanidades Digitais, tem como objetivo compreender as diferenças linguísticas entre textos científicos originais e seus resumos simplificados, produzidos manualmente pelos editores do projeto Young Minds. O Young Minds busca criar resumos que sejam acessíveis a jovens leitores (entre os 8 e os 15 anos), permitindo que compreendam conceitos científicos mesmo sem possuir formação acadêmica ou conhecimento técnico aprofundado na área.\n",
        "\n",
        "A análise se concentra em identificar características como a densidade lexical, índices de legibilidade (Flesch e Fog), razão tipo-token (TTR), proporção de palavras únicas e repetição, entre outras métricas. Para isso, foram utilizadas bibliotecas como **pandas, nltk** e **spaCy**, que permitiram calcular as métricas e examinar as diferenças de forma detalhada entre as versões originais e os resumos\n"

Esta pesquisa também incorpora as atualizações e descobertas que foram feitas na área até recentemente, portanto foi uma parte importante para que o nosso projeto se mantivesse atual e correto.\n",

O seu objetivo passa por investigar preferências de design e interações de leitores Surdos e com Deficiência Auditiva (DHH) com sistemas de Simplificação Automática de Texto (ATS), que combinam abordagens lexicais e sintáticas e também por explorar configurações de design para sistemas ATS com leitores DHH, revelando valores importantes como fluidez e eficiência na leitura. Este estudo revela como a simplificação textual pode fazer a diferença para tornar a nossa sociedade mais inclusiva, fazendo com que todos possamos ter acesso a todo o tipo de conhecimento e recursos independentemente de certas condições que, à primeira vista, seriam condicionantes."

Como tal, foi essencial para uma maior compreensão desta métrica e como esta pode ter influência no desenvolvimento de um texto. Este artigo conceitua a sofisticação lexical como um fenómeno multidimensional e portanto analisa como é usada em 12 componentes principais: prevê níveis de proficiência na escrita numa segunda língua; escores de proficiência lexical holística; crescimento lexical ao longo do tempo; associação direcional de bigramas e trigramas; propriedades de palavras de conteúdo; informação mútua de bigramas; proporções de bigramas e trigramas; especificidade de palavras; propriedades de aquisição de palavras; frequência de palavras de conteúdo; proporções de bigramas e trigramas e frequência de palavras de conteúdo. Todas estas componentes acabam por destacar a natureza multidimensional da sofisticação lexical."

Este paper é mais um exemplo específico de como as métricas podem ser usadas em análises textuais, neste caso em particular o objeto de estudo foram textos usados num programa de leitura que variam no seu nível de complexidade, desde dificuldade fácil a superior. Os parâmetros analisados foram a densidade lexical e a legibilidade destes textos, sendo aplicados três métodos de medição: Halliday (1985), Ure (1971) e Flesch (1948). Com este estudo, ficou concluído que existe pouca evidência de aumento na densidade lexical e na legibilidade em função do aumento dos níveis textuais. Como podemos ver, com a ajuda da análise da densidade lexical podemos concluir se um texto realmente precisa de ser longo e complexo para ser adequado e relevante para leitura."

A densidade lexical é uma métrica que indica a proporção de palavras \"contentivas\" (como substantivos, verbos, adjetivos e advérbios) em relação ao total de palavras num texto. Para calcular esta métrica, considera-se a classe gramatical das palavras e o comprimento das frases, permitindo compreender melhor como o vocabulário é utilizado e de que forma pode influenciar a clareza e a profundidade da comunicação."

        "  - O gráfico de barras compara a densidade lexical ajustada dos textos originais (laranja) e \"Young Minds\" (azul).\n",
        "- **Observações**:\n",
        "  - Os textos originais geralmente apresentam valores mais altos de densidade lexical ajustada, indicando maior complexidade lexical.\n",
        "  - Os textos \"Young Minds\" mostram uma simplificação consistente em relação aos textos originais, refletindo um objetivo de adequação ao público jovem.\n",

Recent climate modelling studies suggest that these storms may become more frequent and severe under a changing climate. Compared to other types of storm events, relatively little is known about the direct and indirect impacts of these storms on forests, as naturally occurring ice storms are inherently difficult to study. Here we describe a novel experimental approach used to create a suite of ice storms in a mature hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. The experiment included five ice storm intensities (0, 6.4, 12.7 and 19.1 mm radial ice accretion) applied in a single year, and one ice storm intensity (12.7 mm) applied in two consecutive years. Results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for creating experimental ice storms, quantify the increase in fine and coarse woody debris mass and nutrients transferred from the forest canopy to the soil under the different icing conditions, and show an increase in the damage to the forest canopy with increasing icing that evolves over time. In this forest, little damage occurred below 6.4 mm radial ice accretion, moderate damage occurred with up to 12.7 mm of accretion, and significant branch breakage and canopy damage occurred with 19.1 mm of ice. The icing in consecutive years demonstrated an interactive effect of ice storm frequency and severity such that some branches damaged in the first year of icing appeared to remain in the canopy and then fall to the ground in the second year of icing. These results have implications for National Weather Service ice storm warning levels, as they provide a quantitative assessment of ice-load related inputs of forest debris that will be useful to municipalities creating response plans for current and future ice storms.\", \"M\\u00e9trica\": \"Lexical Sophistication Young\", \"Valor\": 0.3141025641025641, \"Resumo\": \"Ice storms might sound fascinating, but for forests, they are not as cool as they seem!

Scientists are working hard to figure out the best methods to restore damaged ecosystems. But ecosystem restoration often does not go as planned, resulting in very different ecosystems than before. For example, some animals that used to live in an ecosystem can take a long time to return or do not come back at all. To understand the complexities of ecosystem recovery, scientists have come up with a theory called the asymmetric response concept (ARC), to understand how ecosystems recover. The ARC helps us describe the various responses that can happen after ecosystem damage and why the responses happen that way.

The 4-dimensional DTE Hydrology datacube now fuses high-resolution EO data and advanced modeling of soil moisture, precipitation, evaporation, and river discharge, and here we report the latest validation data in the Mediterranean Basin. This system can now be explored to forecast flooding and landslides and to manage irrigation for precision agriculture. Large-scale implementation of such methods will require further advances to assess high-resolution products across different regions and climates; create and integrate compatible multidimensional datacubes, EO data retrieval algorithms, and models that are suitable across multiple scales; manage uncertainty both in EO data and models; enhance computational capacity via an interoperable, cloud-based processing environment embodying open data principles; and harness AI/machine learning. We outline how various planned satellite missions will further facilitate a DTE for hydrology toward global benefit if the scientific and technological challenges we identify are addressed.\\n\\n\", \"M\\u00e9trica\": \"Lexical Sophistication Young\", \"Valor\": 0.29931972789115646, \"Resumo\": \"Parasitism is the most common feeding mode on earth.

In focal medically refractory epilepsies, successful surgical treatment largely depends on the identification of epileptogenic zone. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 80 and 500 Hz, which can be recorded with EEG, may be novel markers of the epileptogenic zone. This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs. They can be successfully used in pediatric epilepsies such as epileptic spasms and help to understand the generation of this specific type of seizures. While mostly recorded on intracranial EEGs, new studies suggest that identification of HFOs on scalp EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG) is possible as well. Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs. Despite these promising results, the analysis of HFOs is not a routine clinical procedure; most results are derived from relatively small cohorts of patients and many aspects are not yet fully understood. Thus the review concludes that even if HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptic tissue, there are still uncertainties about mechanisms of generation, methods of analysis, and clinical applicability.

Exploiting data from 29,631 users of a smartphone game, we show that, as age increases, working memory (WM) performance is compromised more by distractors presented during WM maintenance than distractors presented during encoding. However, with increasing age, the ability to exclude distraction at encoding is a better predictor of WMC in the absence of distraction. A significantly greater contribution of distractor filtering at encoding represents a potential compensation for reduced WMC in older age.\", \"M\\u00e9trica\": \"Lexical Sophistication Young\", \"Valor\": 0.19760479041916168, \"Resumo\": \"Working memory is the ability to hold information in our minds for a short time, often while we work on it.

We describe the Argo data system and its quality control procedures, and the gradual changes in the vertical resolution and spatial coverage of Argo data from 1999 to 2019. The accuracies of the float data have been assessed by comparison with high-quality shipboard measurements, and are concluded to be 0.002\\u00b0C for temperature, 2.4 dbar for pressure, and 0.01 PSS-78 for salinity, after delayed-mode adjustments.

Therefore, we also aimed to identify other compounds in these alternative plants that can elicit the blissful behavior in cats.\\n\\nBioassays with 6 cats were performed in a low-stress environment, where 5 plants and 13 single compounds were each tested for at least 100 and 17 h, respectively. All responses were video recorded and BORIS software was used to analyze the cats\\u2019 behavior.\\n\\nResults\\nBoth response duration and behavior differed significantly between the cats. While individual cats had preferences for particular plants, the behavior of individual cats was consistent among all plants. About half a dozen lactones similar in structure to nepetalactone were able to elicit the \\u201ccatnip response\\u201d, as were the structurally more distinct molecules actinidine and dihydroactinidiolide. Most cats did not respond to actinidine, whereas those who did, responded longer to this volatile than any of the other secondary plant metabolites, and different behavior was observed. Interestingly, dihydroactinidiolide was also found in excretions and secretions of the red fox, making this the first report of a compound produced by a mammal that can elicit the \\u201ccatnip response\\u201d. A range of different cat-attracting compounds was detected by chemical analysis of plant materials but differences in cat behavior could not be directly related to differences in chemical composition of the plants. Together with results of, among others, habituation / dishabituation experiments, this indicates that additional cat-attracting compounds may be present in the plant materials that remain to be discovered.\\n\\nConclusions\\nCollectively, these findings suggest that both the personality of the cat and genetic variation in the genes encoding olfactory receptors may play a role in how cats respond to cat-attracting plants.

Here we describe a novel experimental approach used to create a suite of ice storms in a mature hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. The experiment included five ice storm intensities (0, 6.4, 12.7 and 19.1 mm radial ice accretion) applied in a single year, and one ice storm intensity (12.7 mm) applied in two consecutive years. Results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for creating experimental ice storms, quantify the increase in fine and coarse woody debris mass and nutrients transferred from the forest canopy to the soil under the different icing conditions, and show an increase in the damage to the forest canopy with increasing icing that evolves over time. In this forest, little damage occurred below 6.4 mm radial ice accretion, moderate damage occurred with up to 12.7 mm of accretion, and significant branch breakage and canopy damage occurred with 19.1 mm of ice. The icing in consecutive years demonstrated an interactive effect of ice storm frequency and severity such that some branches damaged in the first year of icing appeared to remain in the canopy and then fall to the ground in the second year of icing.

Here, we conducted behavioral observations of 38 beef cows (Hereford, Limousine, Charolais, Simmental/NRF/Hereford mix) free-ranging in rugged, forested areas, and fitted with a commercially available virtual fence collar (Nofence) containing a 10Hz tri-axial accelerometer. We used random forest models to calibrate data from the accelerometers on both commonly documented (e.g., feeding, resting, walking) and rarer (e.g., scratching, head butting, self-grooming) behaviors. Our goal was to assess pre-processing decisions including different running mean intervals (smoothing window of 1, 5, or 20 seconds), collar orientation and feature selection (orientation-dependent versus orientation-independent features). We identified the 10 most common behaviors exhibited by the cows. Models based only on orientation-independent features did not perform better than models based on orientation-dependent features, despite variation in how collars were attached (direction and tightness). Using a 20 seconds running mean and orientation-dependent features resulted in the highest model performance (model accuracy: 0.998, precision: 0.991, and recall: 0.989).

As the antiviral immune mechanisms in lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus L.) are poorly understood, lumpfish leukocytes were stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA, which mimic viral infections, and RNA sequencing was performed.\\n\\nMethods: To address this gap, we stimulated lumpfish leukocytes with poly(I:C) for 6 and 24 hours and did RNA sequencing with three parallels per timepoint. Genome guided mapping was performed to define differentially expressed genes (DEGs).\\n\\nResults: Immune genes were identified, and transcriptome-wide analyses of early immune responses showed that 376 and 2372 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed 6 and 24 hours post exposure (hpe) to poly(I:C), respectively. The most enriched GO terms when time had been accounted for, were immune system processes (GO:0002376) and immune response (GO:0006955). Analysis of DEGs showed that among the most highly upregulated genes were TLRs and genes belonging to the RIG-I signaling pathway, including LGP2, STING and MX, as well as IRF3 and IL12A. RIG-I was not identified, but in silico analyses showed that genes encoding proteins involved in pathogen recognition, cell signaling, and cytokines of the TLR and RIG-I signaling pathway are mostly conserved in lumpfish when compared to mammals and other teleost species.\\n\\nConclusions: Our analyses unravel the innate immune pathways playing a major role in antiviral defense in lumpfish. The information gathered can be used in comparative studies and lay the groundwork for future functional analyses of immune and pathogenicity mechanisms.

In scenarios where refugia were lost first or with random loss, less of the initial connectivity was maintained, but more widespread reseeding was possible because more reef cells within smaller networks were maintained.\\n\\nMain conclusions\\nOur findings highlight the importance of maintaining functional coral reef habitat outside of predicted climate refugia to sustain connectivity globally, and suggest an important role for \\u201cstepping stone\\u201d reefs between the climate refugia.

Extension-driven ascent of bodies of deep, hot crust is a very efficient mechanism for rapid heat and mass transfer from deep to shallow crustal levels and is therefore an important mechanism in the evolution of continents. The dominant rock type in exhumed domes is quartzofeldspathic gneiss (typically migmatitic) that does not record its former high-pressure (HP) conditions in its equilibrium mineral assemblage; rather, it records the conditions of emplacement and cooling in the mid/shallow crust. Mafic rocks included in gneiss may, however, contain a fragmentary record of a HP history, and are evidence that their host rocks were also deeply sourced. An excellent example of exhumed deep crust that retains a partial HP record is in the Montagne Noire dome, French Massif Central, which contains well-preserved eclogite (garnet+omphacite+rutile+quartz) in migmatite in two locations: one in the dome core and the other at the dome margin.

Differences in HP deformation fabrics may relate to the position of the eclogite facies rocks relative to zones of transpression and transtension at an early stage of dome development.

Processes in the Antarctic atmosphere, cryosphere, and the Southern Ocean directly influence global atmospheric and oceanic systems. Southern Ocean biogeochemistry has also been shown to have global importance. In contrast, ocean ecological processes are often seen as largely separate from the rest of the global system. In this paper, we consider the degree of ecological connectivity at different trophic levels, linking Southern Ocean ecosystems with the global ocean, and their importance not only for the regional ecosystem but also the wider Earth system. We also consider the human system connections, including the role of Southern Ocean ecosystems in supporting society, culture, and economy in many nations, influencing public and political views and hence policy. Rather than Southern Ocean ecosystems being defined by barriers at particular oceanic fronts, ecological changes are gradual due to cross-front exchanges involving oceanographic processes and organism movement. Millions of seabirds and hundreds of thousands of cetaceans move north out of polar waters in the austral autumn interacting in food webs across the Southern Hemisphere, and a few species cross the equator. A number of species migrate into the east and west ocean-basin boundary current and continental shelf regions of the major southern continents. Human travel in and out of the Southern Ocean region includes fisheries, tourism, and scientific vessels in all ocean sectors. These operations arise from many nations, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, and are important in local communities as well as national economic, scientific, and political activities. As a result of the extensive connectivity, future changes in Southern Ocean ecosystems will have consequences throughout the Earth system, affecting ecosystem services with socio-economic impacts throughout the world. The high level of connectivity also means that changes and policy decisions in marine ecosystems outside the Southern Ocean have consequences for ecosystems south of the Antarctic Polar Front.

The aim of this study was to learn if the behavior seen in response to these plants is similar to the response to catnip. Furthermore, we studied if these responses are fixed or if there are differences between cats. While nepetalactone was identified decades ago as the molecule responsible for the \\u201ccatnip response\\u201d, we know that this volatile is found almost exclusively in catnip. Therefore, we also aimed to identify other compounds in these alternative plants that can elicit the blissful behavior in cats.\\n\\nBioassays with 6 cats were performed in a low-stress environment, where 5 plants and 13 single compounds were each tested for at least 100 and 17 h, respectively. All responses were video recorded and BORIS software was used to analyze the cats\\u2019 behavior.\\n\\nResults\\nBoth response duration and behavior differed significantly between the cats. While individual cats had preferences for particular plants, the behavior of individual cats was consistent among all plants. About half a dozen lactones similar in structure to nepetalactone were able to elicit the \\u201ccatnip response\\u201d, as were the structurally more distinct molecules actinidine and dihydroactinidiolide. Most cats did not respond to actinidine, whereas those who did, responded longer to this volatile than any of the other secondary plant metabolites, and different behavior was observed. Interestingly, dihydroactinidiolide was also found in excretions and secretions of the red fox, making this the first report of a compound produced by a mammal that can elicit the \\u201ccatnip response\\u201d. A range of different cat-attracting compounds was detected by chemical analysis of plant materials but differences in cat behavior could not be directly related to differences in chemical composition of the plants. Together with results of, among others, habituation / dishabituation experiments, this indicates that additional cat-attracting compounds may be present in the plant materials that remain to be discovered.\\n\\nConclusions\\nCollectively, these findings suggest that both the personality of the cat and genetic variation in the genes encoding olfactory receptors may play a role in how cats respond to cat-attracting plants.

Advances in Earth observation (EO) satellite technology are pivotal, and here we provide a roadmap for the exploitation of these methods in a DTE for hydrology. The 4-dimensional DTE Hydrology datacube now fuses high-resolution EO data and advanced modeling of soil moisture, precipitation, evaporation, and river discharge, and here we report the latest validation data in the Mediterranean Basin. This system can now be explored to forecast flooding and landslides and to manage irrigation for precision agriculture. Large-scale implementation of such methods will require further advances to assess high-resolution products across different regions and climates; create and integrate compatible multidimensional datacubes, EO data retrieval algorithms, and models that are suitable across multiple scales; manage uncertainty both in EO data and models; enhance computational capacity via an interoperable, cloud-based processing environment embodying open data principles; and harness AI/machine learning. We outline how various planned satellite missions will further facilitate a DTE for hydrology toward global benefit if the scientific and technological challenges we identify are addressed.\\n\\n\"}, {\"index\": 13, \"abstract_young_minds\": \"Nerve cells, also called neurons, behave like tiny messengers in our bodies that help us sense and move. When brain cells chat with each other, it results in electrical brain waves. Sometimes brain cells chat with each other in a calm and slow way, while other times they are excited and brain activity is faster. This fast electrical activity is called oscillations. Equipment can be used to measure the electrical activity in the brain. The fastest activity that can be measured is called high frequency oscillations (HFOs). Fast brain activity can be super helpful in daily life, helping us to do things like memorize locations and activities, for example. However, if neurons start firing too fast, people can experience a sudden loss of control of certain body parts or even the whole body, which is called epilepsy. In this article, you will learn about brain function and epilepsy and how scientists count the speed of brain waves.

This review discusses the clinical importance of HFOs as markers of epileptogenicity and their application in different types of epilepsies. HFOs are clearly linked to the seizure onset zone, and the surgical removal of regions generating them correlates with a seizure free post-surgical outcome. Moreover, HFOs reflect the seizure-generating capability of the underlying tissue, since they are more frequent after the reduction of antiepileptic drugs.

Thus not only patients with refractory epilepsies and invasive recordings but all patients might profit from the analysis of HFOs.

Processes in the Antarctic atmosphere, cryosphere, and the Southern Ocean directly influence global atmospheric and oceanic systems. Southern Ocean biogeochemistry has also been shown to have global importance. In contrast, ocean ecological processes are often seen as largely separate from the rest of the global system. In this paper, we consider the degree of ecological connectivity at different trophic levels, linking Southern Ocean ecosystems with the global ocean, and their importance not only for the regional ecosystem but also the wider Earth system. We also consider the human system connections, including the role of Southern Ocean ecosystems in supporting society, culture, and economy in many nations, influencing public and political views and hence policy.

After exposing them to higher ultraviolet radiation levels, low oxygen levels, a dry atmosphere, and moisture-free Mars-like soil, these microbes still were able to survive.

        "- O gráfico compara a **densidade lexical** de textos originais com os textos modificados para \"Young Minds\".\n",
        "- A maioria dos pontos parece estar distribuída em uma linha diagonal, o que sugere uma relação consistente entre a densidade lexical dos textos originais e dos adaptados.\n",
        "- Há certa variação, mas os valores de densidade lexical para \"Young Minds\" tendem a ser levemente menores, o que pode indicar uma simplificação lexical nos textos adaptados.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Sofisticação Lexical**:\n",
        "   - A dispersão maior sugere variação mais significativa nas mudanças feitas para ajustar a sofisticação lexical.\n",
        "   - Isso pode ser influenciado pelo vocabulário simplificado e substituição de termos complexos para facilitar a compreensão dos textos.\n"

        "   - Os dados estão mais concentrados e com menor dispersão em relação ao gráfico original.\n",

        "   - Há uma dispersão considerável, mas observa-se uma correlação leve: textos com maior diversidade sintática tendem a apresentar maior sofisticação lexical.\n",

        "- **Interpretação**: A correlação entre **Diversidade Sintática** e **Densidade Lexical** é moderada e positiva (0.44). Isso sugere que, à medida que a diversidade sintática aumenta nos textos originais, a densidade lexical também tende a aumentar. Existe uma relação entre essas duas variáveis, indicando que textos mais sintaticamente variados tendem a usar um vocabulário mais denso, possivelmente pela maior complexidade das estruturas e escolha de palavras.\n",

Isso indica que não há uma relação significativa entre essas duas variáveis nos textos originais.

Similar aos **Textos Originais**, textos do contexto **Young Minds** com maior diversidade sintática tendem a ter uma maior densidade lexical. Isso sugere que, apesar do contexto ser diferente (talvez mais jovem ou com um vocabulário mais simples), ainda há uma tendência de que a diversidade nas estruturas sintáticas se relacione com a utilização de um vocabulário mais rico e variado.\n",

Isso sugere que, no contexto de **Young Minds**, a diversidade sintática pode estar associada a uma diminuição na sofisticação lexical. Ou seja, textos mais diversificados sintaticamente tendem a ser menos sofisticados em termos de vocabulário. Essa relação negativa pode refletir um uso de uma linguagem mais simples e direta, apesar da complexidade nas estruturas de frases.\n",

        "Essas análises indicam que, embora a diversidade sintática esteja relacionada com a densidade lexical em ambos os contextos, ela não está fortemente ligada à sofisticação lexical, especialmente no contexto de **Young Minds**, onde a relação negativa sugere que uma maior variedade sintática pode ser acompanhada de um vocabulário menos sofisticado."

        "A simplificação de textos, tema central desta análise, procura tornar a linguagem mais clara e acessível, sem comprometer o significado principal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Como anteriormente referimos, no segundo artigo científico que analisámos, no contexto de leitores com diferentes necessidades, como Surdos e pessoas com Deficiência Auditiva (DHH), a simplificação textual desempenha um papel essencial para promover a inclusão e a acessibilidade.\n",
        "\n",
        "No estudo analisado, a simplificação textual é apresentada como uma ferramenta crucial para garantir que todos, independentemente de limitações auditivas ou de compreensão, possam aceder às informações e recursos de maneira eficiente e fluída. Isto só é possível através de sistemas de Simplificação Automática de Texto (ATS) que combinam abordagens lexicais (simplificação de palavras e termos) e sintáticas (reestruturação de frases para maior clareza). Estes sistemas, além de melhorar a experiência de leitura, também atendem a preferências específicas de design e interação para públicos DHH, assegurando que a leitura não seja apenas compreensível, mas também agradável e eficaz.\n",
        "\n",
        "Portanto, a simplificação textual transcende o simples ato de modificar textos: ela é na realidade um instrumento para fomentar a igualdade no acesso ao conhecimento, reduzindo as barreiras linguísticas e aumentando a eficiência na transmissão de informações em diferentes contextos sociais. Este processo contribui para uma sociedade mais inclusiva, em que todos podem participar plenamente, independentemente de limitações que possam, de outra forma, dificultar a compreensão de textos originais mais complexos.\n",

Redatores humanos possuem a capacidade de interpretar o contexto, compreender as necessidades do público-alvo e adaptar o conteúdo com empatia e sensibilidade. Contudo, essa subjetividade pode ser tanto uma vantagem quanto um risco, pois as escolhas feitas podem introduzir vieses ou omitir informações essenciais.\n",

        "No contexto das simplificações realizadas no estudo analisado, fica claro que o trabalho humano é crucial para capturar nuances que vão além da linguagem, conectando o conteúdo ao público-alvo de maneira significativa. A ética nesse processo exige respeito pelo leitor e cuidado para não comprometer o significado original, mantendo um equilíbrio entre acessibilidade e fidelidade ao texto. Assim, a simplificação humana é uma ferramenta valiosa, desde que aplicada com rigor e responsabilidade.\n"
